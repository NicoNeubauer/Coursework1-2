    <h2>Mediaschool</h2>

    <p>
        The school i went to before i started to study was about media theory and production.
        In those three year i learned to make many types of products from Photos in a studio
        to animasjon and newsatricles. I really enjoyed my work there and it was the first time
        in my life when school was more than just work for me. In one of the summer breaks i had
        the opportunity to go to germany and make movies with a german production studio where i
        learn a lot of things. Here i include some of the things i have done in my three years.
